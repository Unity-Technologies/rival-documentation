# Standard Characters

The Standard Characters are optional (but highly-recommended) starter assets that come with this package. They can be found under the "Samples" tab of this package in the package manager window.

They contain all the prefabs & code required for first-person and third-person character controllers that can be used as a good starting point to create your own character controllers. You may want to follow the [Tutorial](../tutorial.md) for a guided example of how to use these.
